E-learning systems are successfully employed for education and training in academic and non-academic contexts as a result of the Internet's explosive expansion. Several studies have addressed the need for personalization in the e-learning area, although many e-learning systems still lack it. Many of today's e-learning platforms continue to provide students with various learning preferences with the same educational materials in the same manner. Personalization in e-learning systems includes adaptive interaction, adaptive course delivery, content search and assembly, and adaptive collaborative assistance. Typically, current systems employ one or more learning styles to allow personalization.


This document defines the background of the problem, the existing works that are related to my research topic, the solution that I am planning to implement, and how I am supposed to address the currently facing issues. The past research interests are also explored with their limitations and the research gaps are also identified with relevant reasons. Moreover, this paper further includes the solution methodology, the software and data requirements needed to implement it, the time plan, and the risk mitigation plan for the next few months of research work.
