Dear Sir,
  
For my final year project, I have an idea.

Developing a system for Future Prediction. 
In the current situation, students are avoiding studies and their marking grades decrease.
I trying to develop an application for future prediction using exam results for both students and teachers.
The technologies going to use for Machine learning and Data Science.

As an example:
 The teacher can create questions using the selected module. The system shows these questions as the exam paper.
 After student faces their exam papers, the system shows guides the students on how to increase their exam marks.
 The teachers can show predictions using overall markings.
  

I would be very grateful if you are interested in my idea, We can discuss it. 

Regards,
Ushan Sankalpa
